# Parkinsons diseases prediction
In this scripts, I analyzed the Parkinsons dataset from UCI machine learning repository.

Little, M.A., McSharry, P.E., Roberts, S.J. et al. Exploiting Nonlinear Recurrence and Fractal Scaling Properties for Voice Disorder Detection. BioMed Eng OnLine 6, 23 (2007).

I used two different machine learning methods, logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors algorithm, to train and predict my model. Logistic regression had better acuracy score compared to KNN.
